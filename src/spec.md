# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add clear end-of-post spacing and a final call-to-action on the blog post page, and ensure all course CTAs use the provided affiliate URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Add extra spacing at the very end of the blog post content area and render a final English CTA sentence at the end.
- Make the final CTA include a clickable link that opens in a new tab and points exactly to https://kramis-teppich.coachy.net/lp/rug-making-tutorial/?aff=lishayK007.
- Replace the existing placeholder affiliate href in the blog post’s “Explore the Complete Course” button with the same provided URL and ensure it opens in a new tab.

**User-visible outcome:** On blog post detail pages, readers see a visually separated final CTA at the bottom with a working course link, and the “Explore the Complete Course” button reliably opens the provided affiliate course URL in a new tab.
